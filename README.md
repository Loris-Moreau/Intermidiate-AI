### Boids : 

Boids is an artificial life program that produces highly realistic simulations of the flocking behaviour of birds. 
Each "boid" (an abbreviation of "bird-oid object") follows a straightforward set of rules, which can be summarised as follows :

- **Separation** : boids move away from other boids that are too close

- **Alignment** : boids attempt to match the velocities of their neighbors

- **Cohesion** : boids move toward the center of mass of their neighbors
